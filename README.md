# knots-installer
Install script for Bitcoin Knots.
I generated this script with AI and modified it to suit my needs.

It installs and configures a full bitcoin node using the Knots implementation with IPv4 plus a Tor Hidden service.

Tested working on Debian. May work on other debian-based distributions.
